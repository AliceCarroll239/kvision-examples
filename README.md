# KVision examples

A set of examples for [KVision](https://github.com/rjaros/kvision) framework.

### Important!

##### We are in the process of transforming the examples to Gradle Kotlin DSL and new MPP. Some examples (in particular the `template` project) has already been ported, but the KVision Guide hasn't been updated yet. Look for the README file inside individual projects for information about new Gradle tasks.

##### Since [Kotlin 1.3.40](https://blog.jetbrains.com/kotlin/2019/06/kotlin-1-3-40-released/) new type inference has been enabled by default in the IntelliJ IDE. There are some incompatibilities, that can result in errors presented in the IDE for some of the example projects. You may wish to [disable this option](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/compiler-kotlin-compiler.html).   

## Template

An application template. It does nothing, but includes all dependencies to develop KVision applications with all
supported components (including unit tests). A perfect starting point for a new application.

[See live demo](https://rjaros.github.io/kvision-examples/template/)

## Hello World

A very simple application with almost no optional modules.

[See live demo](https://rjaros.github.io/kvision-examples/helloworld/)

## Showcase

A simple application presenting all main features of KVision framework.

[See live demo](https://rjaros.github.io/kvision-examples/showcase/)

## Address book

An address book application presenting a classic [CRUD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Create,_read,_update_and_delete) project 
with Material-like CSS template from [Bootswatch](https://bootswatch.com/3/paper/).

[See live demo](https://rjaros.github.io/kvision-examples/addressbook/)

## Address book with Tabulator

An address book application rewritten with a [Tabulator](http://tabulator.info) module.

[See live demo](https://rjaros.github.io/kvision-examples/addressbook-tabulator/)

## Desktop

A very simple desktop with four mini applications - a calculator, a text editor, a paint program and a web browser.

[See live demo](https://rjaros.github.io/kvision-examples/desktop/)

## Pokedex PWA

The list of Pok√©mon with live search, build with Redux module. It's also a fully compatible [PWA](https://developers.google.com/web/progressive-web-apps/).

[See live demo](https://kvision-pokedex.netlify.com/)

## TodoMVC

A complete implementation of [TodoMVC](http://todomvc.com/) demo application.

[See live demo](https://rjaros.github.io/kvision-examples/todomvc/)

## Address book - fullstack

A complete, multiplatform address book application. It presents an innovative way to build fullstack applications with KVision and 
[Ktor](https://ktor.io), [Jooby](https://jooby.org) or [Spring Boot](https://spring.io/projects/spring-boot) frameworks. KVision closely integrates the client and the server side of the project with a 
shared data model and fully type-safe connectivity between both sides (based on automatically generated routings and JSON-RPC 
endpoints). The example project utilizes:

- H2 SQL database (local) or PostgreSQL database (configured on Heroku)
- [Exposed](https://github.com/JetBrains/Exposed) Kotlin SQL library for database connectivity (used in Ktor version)
- [Kwery](https://github.com/andrewoma/kwery) ORM for database connectivity (used in Jooby and Spring Boot versions)
- [Pac4J](https://github.com/pac4j/pac4j) security engine for authentication and profile management (used in Jooby and Spring Boot versions)

The architecture of the project is heavily based on Kotlin coroutines, wrapping asynchronous client-server calls into 
easy-to-read synchronous-like code.

[See live demo on Heroku](https://kvision-address-book.herokuapp.com/)

## Number converter - fullstack

A simple application to convert integer numbers to words by using JVM [Tradukisto](https://github.com/allegro/tradukisto) library.

[See live demo on Heroku](https://kvision-numbers.herokuapp.com/)

## Encoder - fullstack

A simple application to encode the given text, based on the overview chapter from the [KVision guide](https://kvision.gitbook.io/kvision-guide/part-3-server-side-interface/overview).

[See live demo on Heroku](https://kvision-encoder.herokuapp.com/)

## Tweets - fullstack

A simple, multiplatform, message board application based on websocket communication. 

[See live demo on Heroku](https://kvision-tweets.herokuapp.com/)

## Template - fullstack

A fullstack application template (versions for all supported frameworks). A starting point for a new application.

## Simple MPP - fullstack

A fullstack MPP application created without KVision, but using kvision-remote module for server-side connectivity. 
It's based on an official [Ktor MPP example](https://github.com/ktorio/ktor-samples/tree/master/mpp/fullstack-mpp).

## Template - Electron

An application template for [Electron](https://electronjs.org/) framework. It shows how to build cross-platform 
(Windows, Linux, MacOS), desktop applications with KVision and Kotlin. 

## Template - Apache Cordova

An application template for [Apache Cordova](https://cordova.apache.org/) framework. It shows how to build mobile (Android, iOS),
hybrid applications with KVision and Kotlin.
